console.log(10 - 3);
console.log(2 + 4);

// As you've seen in the previous section, the + operator can also be used on strings data to merge multiple strings as one:
let message = 'Hello ' + 'human!';
console.log(message);

// When you add a number and a sting, JavaScript will perform a type coercion
let sum = 'Hi ' + 89;
console.log(sum);
