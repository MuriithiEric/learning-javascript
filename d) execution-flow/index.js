// A language processor such as Node.js executes statements in a top-down approach. The statement written in the first line will be executed before the second line, then continue down to the last line:

console.log('Hello World!');
console.log("I'm learning JavaScript");

// Printing numbers
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
